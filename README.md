#  Vegetable Classifier  

##  Description  
This project is a **vegetable classification model** trained using a fine-tuned **ResNet** model. It can classify 15 different types of vegetables based on images. The goal is to enable real-time vegetable recognition, which can be used for applications like smart grocery sorting or food tracking.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Uses **ResNet** for high-accuracy classification.  
- Pre-trained and fine-tuned for **15 vegetable categories**.  
- Google Colab notebook available for easy training and model export.  
- Can be integrated with **TensorFlow.js** for web or mobile apps.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  
- **Dataset**: [https://github.com/joneikholmkea/veggies]  
- **TensorFlow.js** (for deployment in web/mobile)  

## ðŸ“‚ Model Training
